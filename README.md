#### Project Name

A brief description of the project and its purpose.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the NBA 2K20 ratings compared to real-life player performance during the 2019-2020 NBA season. The goal is to identify the correlation between in-game ratings and actual player statistics such as points, assists, and rebounds.

### ### `data/`

Contains all datasets used in the project.

- **`raw/`**: Stores unprocessed data files as they are originally received (e.g., CSV, JSON). It’s important to keep the raw data unchanged.
- **`final/`**: Stores cleaned, transformed, or aggregated data. After you’ve processed the raw data (e.g., handled missing values, applied transformations), save the result here.

### `notebooks/`

Contains Jupyter notebooks used for analysis. Notebooks are used to explore, analyze, and visualize data.

- **`analysis.py`**: Contains functions for performing analysis, generating reports, or running machine learning models.

### `.gitignore`

Specifies files and directories to ignore in version control (Git). This file ensures that temporary files, local environment setups, and raw data files are not pushed to the repository.

### `README.md`

The main file for the project overview, setup instructions, and general guidance. This document explains the purpose and structure of the repository, along with any important project information.

### `CHANGELOG.md`

A log that tracks changes and updates to the project. This is useful for versioning and documenting what’s changed between releases.
